###
A small cheat sheet on using GPG
###

===
View existing Keys
===

gpg --list-keys

===
Generating Revocation
===

gpg --output [REVOCATION FILE NAME] --gen-revoke [KEY ID]

===
Exporting Public key
===

gpg --output [PUBLIC KEY FILE NAME] --export [KEY ID]

For ASCII ouput
---

gpg --armor --export [KEY ID]

===
Importing Public key
===

gpg --import [PUBLIC KEY FILE NAME]

gpg --list-keys (to see if the new key has come in)

gpg --edit-key [IMPORTED KEY ID]

>fpr (verify fingerprint)
>sign (sign the key)
>check (check the key)

===
Signing Document (Compressed)
===

gpg --output [SIGNED FILE NAME] --sign [UNSIGNED FILE NAME]

Verifying Signatures
---

gpg --output [DECRYPTED FILE NAME] --decrypt [SIGNED FILE NAME]

===
Signing Document (Clearsigned)
===

gpg --clearsign [UNSIGNED FILE NAME]

===
Signing Document (Detached)
===

gpg --output [SIGNATURE FILE NAME] --detach-sig [UNSIGNED FILE NAME]

For ASCII output
---

gpg --armor --output [SIGNATURE FILE NAME] --detach-sig [UNSIGNED FILE NAME]

===
Verifying Documents
===

gpg --verify [SIGNED FILE NAME]

For Detached Signatures
---

gpg --verify [SIGNATURE FILE NAME] [UNSIGNED FILE NAME]

===
Ecrypting and Decrypting Documents
===

gpg --output [ENCRYPTED FILE NAME] --encrypt --recipient [RECIPIENT KEY ID] [UNENCRYPTED FILE NAME]

gpg --output [DECRYPTED FILE NAME] --decrypt [ENCRYPTED FILE NAME]


Symmetric Cyphers
---

gpg --output [ENCRYPTED FILE NAME] --symmetric [UNENCRYPTED FILE NAME]

===
Distributing keys
===

gpg --keyserver [SERVER NAME] --recv-key [KEY ID]

gpg --keyserver [SERVER NAME] --send-key [KEY ID]

===
Obtaining secret key back for other purposes
===

In case the secret key to the master key was removed for security purposes you
face the following error when trying to edit the master key.

***
NOTE: Before executing you need to make sure you have backed up the Master key
before you removed the secret part of the Master key
***

gpg: secret key parts are not available
gpg: signing failed: Unusable secret key error

To solved it delete existing master key

$ gpg --delete-secret-and-public-key [KEY ID]

Then import from the private and public back up

$ gpg --import [private key file] [public key file]

After you finish your signing work or add user work (which requires the master
private key) make sure to follow the securing process again:

$ gpg --export-secret-subkeys [KEY ID] > subkeys
$ gpg --delete-secret-key [KEY ID]
$ gpg --import subkeys
$ rm subkeys

===
Backing up gpg stuff
===

gpg --export-secret-keys --armor [KEY ID] > [PRIVATE KEY FILE NAME]

gpg --export --armor [KEY ID] > [PUBLIC KEY FILE NAME]

gpg --export-secret-subkeys [KEY ID] > [SUBKEYS FILE NAME]

===
Important commands in gpg prompt
===

** No key selected implies changes may be applied to the primary master key

> adduid - Add a new user id
> addkey - Add a new subkey
> key <id> - Select a key
> uid <id> - Select a uid
> sign - Sign a key
> check - Check a key
> fpr - Display fingerprint of the key

After a key / uid is selected then you apply

> deluid - Delete user id
> delkey - Delete subkey
> revkey - Revoke a key
> revsig - Revoke a signature
> trust - Change the trust level of a key
